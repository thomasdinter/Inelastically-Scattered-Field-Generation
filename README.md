**(1)** Find the complex-valued spatial distribution of the light inelastically scattered from each translational degrees of freedom of a levitated dipolar scatterer, in the focal plane of some collection lens, having been transformed by a high numerical aperture parabolic mirror.

**(2)** Estimate the coupling efficiency of each inelastically scattered field component into several low-order modes of the LP mode basis of a few-mode optical fiber.
