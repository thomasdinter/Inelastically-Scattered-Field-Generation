# Inelastically-Scattered-Field-From-a-Levitated-Dipolar-Scatterer
This is the code used in https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2409.08827 to:

(1) Find the spatial mode (amplitude and phase distribution) of the light inelastically scattered from each translational degrees of freedom of a levitated dipolar scatterer, having been transformed by a parabolic mirror. 
(2) Estimate the coupling of each inelastically scattered field component into the LP mode basis of a few-mode optical fiber.
